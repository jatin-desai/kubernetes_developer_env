# Microservice / Application Development Standards


## Application Logging Configuration
* Application environment information (kubernetes node and pod details) passed into the application via deployment config
* Assumes that the application logging has placeholders for env. properties (pcf org etc) which can be remapped to kubernetes concepts
* {Optional} update to logging config to add additional identifying information (refer to logback xml)
* Support for log level changes via environment property change - only push without require package rebuild



## Monitoring
* AppDynamics agent embedded in the base images
* AppDynamics configuration passed by deploy pipeline - as a part of the kube config
