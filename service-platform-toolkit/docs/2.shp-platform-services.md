# Platform Services

## Logging

### Platform Logging Configuration
* Fluentd used as the underlying log data collector for the kubernetes cluster
* Fluentd pods configured on each cluster node to collect log data - via daemonset
* Fluentd configuration via configmaps
* Syslog endpoints for each app configured on a per namespace basis
* Platform logging to Elasticseach-Kibana
* Application logging to Splunk via Syslog
* TBD: Node logfile rotation and clean-up


### Platform Log Management and Analytics
* Streaming of logs to different endpoints
  * e.g. ES-Kibana for kubernetes system logs
  * e.g. Syslog/Splunk for application logs
