# Desktop Setup - Kubernetes Cluster w/Minikube


## Desktop Working directory & Git projects

The scripts and toolkit assumes a certain structure of the git projects on the developer desktop

1. Create a base working folder for SHP on your desktop - e.g. $HOME/sandbox/shp
2. I'll refer to this as the `SHP_HOME` - refer to [SHP Config](./07.shp-config.md)
3. Clone all 3 service-platform projects (service-platform-toolkit, service-platform-operations and shp-hsbc-utils) into the `$SHP_HOME`
4. Ensure any Microservice projects are also cloned into the `$SHP_HOME` base folder only


## Execution environment for the Service Platform Scripts

NOTE: All scripts should be run from the `$SHP_HOME` folder only



## Create and setup minikube cluster and supporting services

```

./service-platform-toolkit/setup_local.sh

```

The `setup_local.sh` script is responsible for creating the minikube cluster and setting up the private docker registry required for use by kubernetes

Refer to the script for details - all steps in the script are fully documented and explained.

## Create the HSBC Base Image(s)

```

./service-platform-toolkit/setup_base_image.sh

```

This script will create the Java Base image incorporating the hsbc certs and adding the appdynamics agent into the image

Refer to the script for details - all steps are fully documented

## Create the Team Namespace

```

./service-platform-toolkit/setup_new_team.sh

```

This script creates a new namespace in the kubernetes cluster - this is based on the approach that each team should use it's own namespace

Again, refer to the script for details.


## Build & Run a Microservice

```

./service-platform-toolkit/microservice.sh

```

This script takes a microservice project, builds it, creates the docker images and then deploys the service to the kubernetes cluster

Once again, refer to the script for the details.


## Bonus Scripts !!

For those interested in running the cluster with DNS support and exposing each team as a sub-domain, use the scripts with the suffix `_dns`

Note: You can only use the dns scripts of the kubernetes cluster has also been setup with dns support - i.e. with `setup_local_dns.sh`

Refer to the scripts for the details
