# Working with minikube over VPN

## Background
When the VPN connection is active, it creates additional routes and all traffic is then routed via the VPN. As such, this traffic, then doesn't have a way back to the minikube vm as the global dns is not able to resolve the ip

As a resolution, you need to proxy the specific minikube VM ports you need to localhost and then use these to connect.

## Pre-Reqs
This method assumes that you already have a minikube created *a priori*. It also assumes you are using the **`virtualbox`** vm-driver.  

## Approach to configure minikube env.
**Note: This is just for awareness.** You donot need to run these scripts if you use the setup_local.sh cli to create your cluster. The script does the necessary vbox changes listed below.

By default, when you are working over VPN, you will not be able to connect to the minikube vm and minikube and kubectl commands will time-out. To overcome this, you will need to configure the minikube vm to nat the vm ports to the localhost ports and then configure kubectl to use these ports

1. Configure the nat config on the VM
```
VBoxManage controlvm minikube natpf1 kube-apiserver,tcp,127.0.0.1,8443,,8443
VBoxManage controlvm minikube natpf1 kube-dashboard,tcp,127.0.0.1,30000,,30000
VBoxManage controlvm minikube natpf1 kube-docker,tcp,127.0.0.1,2376,,2376
VBoxManage controlvm minikube natpf1 kube-ingress,tcp,127.0.0.1,80,,80
```
2. Create the minikube context using localhost over VPN
```
# create a minikube-vpn context and configure the api server to use the localhost:8443 endpoint
kubectl config set-cluster minikube-vpn --server=https://127.0.0.1:8443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify
kubectl config set-context minikube-vpn --cluster=minikube-vpn --user=minikube
```

## Using minikube over VPN
When you are connected over VPN, run the following command to change your kubectl context
```
# switch to the new context after connecting to VPN
kubectl config use-context minikube-vpn
```

When in office, change the context back
```
# switch to using the default minikube context
kubectl config use-context minikube
```
