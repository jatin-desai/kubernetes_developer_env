# Service Hosting Platform Services


## Docker services
* DNS Service
  * for resolving the cluster domain name
* Docker Registry Service
  * registry for use by the kubernetes cluster to pull application images



## Kubernetes Services

* Kubernetes Dashboard
  * configured with the Ingress controller
  * 2 options - as sub-domain and as a path
    - ```http://dashboard.system.local.service.platform```
    - ```http://system.local.service.platform/dashboard```


* Log streaming - fluentd
  * deployed as a daemonset to ensure that 1 instance runs on each node
  * streams the kubernetes logs to syslog and elasticsearch endpoints
  * custom fluentd images created
    - only syslog - ```jatindesai/fluentd:v0.12.33-syslog```
    - syslog + es - ```jatindesai/fluentd:v0.12.33-es-syslog```
    - only es - ```jatindesai/fluentd:v0.12.33-es```
  * kube-config
      - ```service-platform-toolkit/utils/kube-config/services/logging/fluentd```
  * refer to [docs/6.shp-logging-config.md](./6.shp-logging-config.md) for fluentd configuration details - using elasticsearch-kibana for platform logging and syslog/splunk for application logging


*  Log management - elasticsearch and kibana
  * for managing kubernetes system logs
  * kibana dashboard configured at - ```http://kibana.system.local.service.platform```
  * kube-config
      - ```service-platform-toolkit/utils/kube-config/services/logging/es-kibana```


* Application Monitoring
  * AppDynamics configured as a part of the base buildpack
  * Configuration externalized into - ```shp-hsbc-utils/appd/appd-config.sh```


* Platform Monitoring
  * TBD


## CI-CD Pipeline

* Jenkins Pipeline (WIP)
  * jenkins image with docker and kubernetes plugins created
  * support for running jenkins on the desktop for development
  * image - ```jatindesa/jenkins:lts-alpine```
  * to run jenkins locally - as a docker container
    * ```docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  -v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker -v /Users/shared/sandbox/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jatindesai/jenkins:lts-alpine```
    * access jenkins at ```http://localhost:8080/```
    * update proxy to the cntlm proxy once jenkins is up and running
    * don't install any plugins - plugin download is blocked from hsbc network - and all required plugins are already included in the image
    * configure jdk, maven (name:maven) and docker (name:docker) in the Global Tools configuration page
    * use the groovy sample script as getting started to create the first job
    * Note:
      * the script reuses the cli scripts - this is a tactical approach - not the recommended approach of using the plugins
      * the kube deploy step is currently not working
      * the intention of this script is to provide a structure for development of the pipeline - replacing each stage from cli to plugin
