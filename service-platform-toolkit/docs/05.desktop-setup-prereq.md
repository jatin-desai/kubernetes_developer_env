1. (SU Access) Install VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. (SU Access) Install Docker CE (required admin access) - https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download

3. Download kubectl and add it to your path - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

4. Download minikube and add it to your path - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/#install-minikube

5. Create an account at hub.docker.com (if you don't already have 1) - https://hub.docker.com/

6. Install cntlm - refer to documentation here - https://digital-confluence.systems.uk.hsbc/confluence/display/AWSP/cntlm
    - configure it as a system service using launchd (this will ensure it is always running)
    - ensure you specify the PassNTLMv2 password config
    - ensure you specify the header config
    - add \*.platform to the NoProxy list

7. (SU Access) Configure /etc/hosts
    - for virtualbox vm driver
      ```
      192.168.99.100 local.service.platform
      ```
    - for hyperkit vm driver
      - determine the ip address assigned to minikube `$(minikube ip)` - it should be `192.168.64.*`
      - map that ip address to `local.service.platform`
      - **note:** unlike virtualbox, hyperkit provides a different ip address each time the vm is created


9. To access the local domains from your browser - recommend that you configure 1 of your browsers to use the cntlm proxy
  - this will ensure that it can redirect local urls to the

10. Docker configuration (Docker Preferences)
    - Proxy configuration
      - Manual proxy configuration
        - Web Server: http://host.docker.internal:3128
        - Secure Web Server: http://host.docker.internal:3128
        - Bypass proxy: host.docker.internal, \*.platform, 192.168.*
    - Configure insecure Registry
      - host.docker.internal:5000
    - Daemon configuration (Advanced tab)
      - copy ./shp-utils/security/root-ca.pem to /Users/Shared/bin
      - add "tlscacert" : "/Users/Shared/bin/hsbc-root-ca.pem"
    - Apply changes and restart

11. Update you .bash_profile to use the cntlm proxy for you shell
    - add http_proxy, https_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY to point to http://127.0.0.1:3128
    - this will ensure that when you launch the terminal shell, you will always use cntlm

12. run `docker login` from your terminal window and login to docker hub
    - you will need to do this only as a one-off


### Optional steps:

#### Hyperkit driver

It is possible to use Hyperkit (a lightweight macOS virtualization solution built on top of the Hypervisor.framework in macOS 10.10+) instead of VirtualBox as a hypervisor. To enable Hyperkit with Minikube, use the `--vm-driver=hyperkit` argument of the `minikube start` command.

The Hyperkit driver will eventually replace the existing xhyve driver.
It is built from the minikube source tree, and uses [moby/hyperkit](http://github.com/moby/hyperkit) as a Go library.

To install the hyperkit driver (SU Access):

```shell
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit \
&& chmod +x docker-machine-driver-hyperkit \
&& sudo mv docker-machine-driver-hyperkit /usr/local/bin/ \
&& sudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit \
&& sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-hyperkit
```

The hyperkit driver currently requires running as root to use the vmnet framework to setup networking.

If you encountered errors like `Could not find hyperkit executable`, you might need to install [Docker for Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
